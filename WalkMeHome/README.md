# WalkMeHome


“Am I safe?” 

Maybe you know your way around, or maybe you are new to an area. For women, finding the saftest way to simply walk outside is something that we have to think about as commonly as we do traffic. 

As a team, we wanted to design a platform for women to mark where they have felt uncomfortable and provide a way to navigate through the world with other women’s experience taken into account. How would you advise your friend to get home? “This road is well lit, but stay away from that bus stop in front of the liquor store.” What would someone want their daughter to know? A family member?

By collecting this data, we can look out for each other, as well as notify lawmakers and business owners about potential problems. Yes, all women and #metoo can have live data points of what women experience daily and a potent conversation piece when combating non-believers. 

Our team sees this concept as having the potential to grow into a way to study women’s safety and even potentially be a social accountability system like Yelp. “Lets go for drinks! This place has good food, and it's a place other women recommend.”  We are hoping this social pressure of not having multiple reports of bad experiences will push business owners to “hold the public space” better and actively look out for predators. This pressure could spark initiatives such as trainings for employees to notice when women are recipients of relentless unsolicited attention or more comprehensive laws on street harassment.  

Honestly,  a world that is safer for women is net safer for all folks of all genders, and we would hope that this can act as a model to ensure that everyone gets home safe.
