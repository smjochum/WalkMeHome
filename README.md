# WalkMeHome
Routes home using crowd sourced data

## Inspiration
“Am I safe?” 
Maybe you know you’re way around maybe you are new to an area. For women finding the safest way to simply walk outside is something as commonly place as navigating to avoid traffic and WalkMeHome treats it as the obstacle and real threat that it is. 

Our team wanted to design a platform for women to mark where they have felt uncomfortable and a way to navigate through the world with other women’s experience taken into account. How would you advise your friend to get home? “This road is well lit, stay away from that bus stop in front of the liquor store.” What would someone want their daughter to know? 
Through Esri’s platform, we have the capabilities to collect and store live data, as well as underlay existing crime statistics for an area, and even record users notes to arm folks with invaluable local knowledge. 
By collecting this data we can look out for each other, as well as notify lawmakers and business owners about potential problems. Yes, all women, and #metoo can have live data points of what women’s daily experience, and a potent conversation piece when combating non-believers. 

Our team sees this concept having the potential to grow into a way to study women’s safety, and even potentially be a social accountability system very much so like yelp. “Lets go for drinks! This place has good food and a place other women recommend.”  We are hoping this social pressure of not having multiple reports of bad experiences will push business owns to “hold the public space” better and actively look out for predators. Maybe even require training for employees to notice when women are recipients of relentless unsolicited attention.  
When it comes down to it, a world that is safer for women is safer for all folks of all genders, and we would hope that this can act as a model for all people to get home safe. 

## What it does
At the moment, we have the capability of find the user’s location and placing a dot on it. This is a start! Esri is an incredibly powerful tool with LOTS of functionality. We met a bit of a learning curve figuring out terminology, choosing the appropriate features, and piecing it all together in time. This weekend three of the four team members fell terribly ill, which greatly slowed production, and the last dev hacking now knows survival Java. 

## Looking Ahead

All four of us and some friends we pitched to along the way are excited to stay in touch and continue development on this much needed service and collection of this potent data set.

#Notes on Intended Usage
We spent much energy talking about how to design an app that would give the needed safety data without stressing out or even triggering our users. Hearing details of someone being seriously and violently hurt nearby when causally mapping a walk home we decided would negatively affect our user’s mental health. 

With this discussion in mind we chose to have all reports weighted the same and to be a tool to record when and when the uncomfortable moments of a women's day are with a simple, causal, and anonymous check mark. "marked uncomfortable". We would want people to not feel bad about marking workplaces or restaurants, and for others to see that maybe those companies and establishments may have a problem. The scary stuff, although severely under-reported, we'll leave for now to Esri's crime layer from verified police data, and take this into account in our routing feature to come.
